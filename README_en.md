[简体中文](README.md)

Jrag is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform built on Java Spring Boot, designed to enhance the application of large language models in the Java ecosystem by combining retrieval and generation technologies. The platform supports access to multiple mainstream large language model interfaces, including Ollama and OpenAI, and integrates two vector databases, Milvus and Redis, to provide efficient vector storage and retrieval services.
